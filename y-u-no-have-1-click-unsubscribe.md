# Y U No Have 1 Click Unsubscribe? UX Fail. My TextExpander is locked and loaded for you!

I just wanted to let you know that if I hit unsubscribe and get a login form or if your email does not give me an option to unsubscribe, I report your email as SPAM.  You already know my email address, you can/should give me a unique 1-click link to unsubscribe.  I don't mind an intuitive confirm button - but don't make me login or provide my email on the confirmation page. 

**This email falls into that category and was reported as SPAM.**

Below are some links to best practices. Please keep usability and a good customer experience in mind, rather than the letter of the law to keep the subscriber counts high.
